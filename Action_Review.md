- Created `/templete` directory and sample templates.
- Implemented API routes for templates and email sending.
- Implemented Frontend with a modern, clean dark theme using CSS variables and Flexbox/Grid.
- Implemented Notion Integration:
    - API to fetch roles from Notion database.
    - API to fetch recipients based on selected roles, extracting ALL properties for template substitution.
    - Frontend UI to toggle between Manual and Notion source, and store full recipient objects.
    - Updated Send API to handle dynamic property replacement (e.g., `{{Company}}`, `{{Role}}`).
- Implemented Notion Template Management:
    - Added `NOTION_TEMPLATE_DATABASE_ID` to environment variables.
    - Created API `app/api/notion/templates` to fetch and save templates to Notion.
    - Updated Frontend to display merged list of Local and Notion templates.

- Updated `README.md` with environment variable documentation including Notion keys.
- Fixed Vercel build errors:
    - Workaround for missing `notion.databases.query` method by using `notion.request`.
    - Fixed implicit `any` type error in `app/api/notion/recipients/route.ts`.
    - Fixed type mismatch for `DatabaseObjectResponse` in `app/api/notion/roles/route.ts` by casting to `any`.
    - Enhanced `app/api/notion/roles/route.ts` and `app/api/notion/recipients/route.ts` to support `role`, `Role`, and `Roles` property names dynamically.
    - Added detailed error logging in `app/api/notion/roles/route.ts` to help diagnose missing properties or incorrect Database IDs.
    - Fixed missing `properties` field issue by specifying Notion API version `2022-06-28` in Client initialization.
    - Applied same fixes to `app/api/notion/templates/route.ts` to ensure Notion templates load correctly.
- Added recipient list display feature:
    - After fetching recipients from Notion, the UI now displays a scrollable list showing each recipient's name and email address.
    - The list is styled with a clean card design and supports up to 200px height with scroll.
- Implemented real-time email sending progress:
    - Converted send API to use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming responses.
    - Frontend now displays each email's send status immediately after it's sent, instead of waiting for all emails to complete.
    - Users can see real-time progress in the Activity Log as emails are being sent.
- Fixed email rendering issues:
    - Added proper HTML email template with CSS styling.
    - Emails now display correctly with white background, proper fonts, and clean formatting.
    - Fixed layout issues that caused dark/white split screen rendering.
- Added rich text editor support:
    - Installed and integrated React Quill rich text editor.
    - Created reusable RichTextEditor component with full formatting toolbar.
    - Modified send API to handle HTML content directly instead of Markdown.
    - Users can now format emails with bold, italic, colors, lists, links, images, etc.

    - Updated UI to be fully English.
- Next Steps:
    - Verify email sending functionality with dynamic properties.
    - Verify Notion template saving and loading.
    - Deploy to Vercel and verify production build.
